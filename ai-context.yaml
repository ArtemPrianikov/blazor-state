    description: A library for managing state in Blazor applications.
    pattern: Mediator Pattern
    conventions:
      - Actions are nested classes within the State they mutate.
      - State should NOT be mutated by anything other than handlers.
      - Handlers are nested classes within the State they mutate.
      - State classes should override the Initialize() method.
      - Handlers should inherit from BlazorState.Handlers.ActionHandler.
